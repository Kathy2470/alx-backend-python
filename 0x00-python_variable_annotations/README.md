Tasks
0. Basic Annotations - Add
Write a type-annotated function add that takes two floats a and b as arguments and returns their sum as a float.

1. Basic Annotations - Concat
Write a type-annotated function concat that takes two strings str1 and str2 as arguments and returns a concatenated string.

2. Basic Annotations - Floor
Write a type-annotated function floor that takes a float n as an argument and returns the floor of the float.

3. Basic Annotations - To String
Write a type-annotated function to_str that takes a float n as an argument and returns the string representation of the float.

4. Define Variables
Define and annotate the following variables with the specified values:

a: an integer with a value of 1
pi: a float with a value of 3.14
i_understand_annotations: a boolean with a value of True
school: a string with a value of "Holberton"
5. Complex Types - List of Floats
Write a type-annotated function sum_list that takes a list of floats as an argument and returns their sum as a float.

6. Complex Types - Mixed List
Write a type-annotated function sum_mixed_list that takes a list of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

7. Complex Types - String and Int/Float to Tuple
Write a type-annotated function to_kv that takes a string k and an int or float v as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element is the string k. The second element is the square of the int/float v and should be annotated as a float.

8. Complex Types - Functions
Write a type-annotated function make_multiplier that takes a float multiplier as an argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by the multiplier.

9. Let's Duck Type an Iterable Object
Annotate the element_length functionâ€™s parameters and return values with the appropriate types.

10. Duck Typing - First Element of a Sequence
Augment the safe_first_element function with the correct duck-typed annotations.

11. More Involved Type Annotations
Add type annotations to the safely_get_value function based on the given parameters and return values.

12. Type Checking
Use mypy to validate the zoom_array function and apply any necessary changes.
